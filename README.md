# 🧠 LM Studio API (Extended)

This crate extends [`rs-lm-studio-api`](https://github.com/fuderis/rs-lm-studio-api) 
by [Bulat Sh.], adding **embedding support**.
Use this to interact with locally hosted LM Studio models — send prompts, receive 
completions (streaming or not), and now... generate embeddings as well!


---

## Features

- ✅ Chat completions (fully async, with or without streaming)
- ✅ Embedding support (POST /v1/embeddings, sync-style usage)
- ✅ Minimal setup — just point to your LM Studio server
- ✅ Customizable prompts, model selection, and context memory

---

## Quick Start

Add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
lm-studio-api-extended = "0.1.3"
```

## Examples
Check out the **examples/** directory for working demos. You can run them like this:

```bash
cargo run --example embedding_test
cargo run --example chat_completion
cargo run --example chat_completion_streaming
```
